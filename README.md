## Description

**LyaRT** performs a Monte Carlo calculation of the radiative transfer of Lyman-alpha photons as they diffuse through a cloud of neutral gas. The code is written in `C`, but there is code for running and validating the results written in both `Python`and `ÃŒDL`. This code was developed as part of my PhD thesis, and it has been used in numerous publications: [Orsi et al. 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.425...87O), [Orsi et al., 2016](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.456.3827O), [Bielby et al., 2016](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.456.4061B), [Gurung-Lopez et al. 2018](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180700006G) and [Gurung-Lopez et al.2019](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181109630G). 


Check out this Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCiQjIKlpU4) that shows a visual execution of the code, run over a dozen of photons for clarity.

## Documentation

This [pdf file](https://github.com/aaorsi/LyaRT/blob/master/doc/mclyart.pdf) contains a full description of the physics and implementation of **LyaRT**. It is extracted directly from a chapter of my Phd Thesis.
